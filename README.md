> Visualisations of the main smflooding research for outreach purposes

This repository contains some cool visualisations linked to my [social media flooding research](https://github.com/sbrl/research-smflooding). They are primarily intended for outreach activities, like the [hull science festival](https://scifest.hull.ac.uk/).
